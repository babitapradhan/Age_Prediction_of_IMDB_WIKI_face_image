# Age_Prediction_of_IMDB_WIKI_face_image
The objective of the project is to predict the age of person based on their face image. Pytorch was used to train a Convolutional deep Neural Network with face images from IMDB/WIKI dataset on a kaggle platform. Accuracy for different CNN architectures with different hyper parameters setting was evaluated.
